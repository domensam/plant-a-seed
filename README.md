# 🌸 Plant A Seed

> A gentle progress tracker that helps you enjoy your journey of self-improvement — one seed at a time.

## 🌿 About This Project
This repository serves as both the **project log** and **codebase** for *Plant A Seed*, a web app that turns goal tracking into something joyful, not stressful.

If this sounds like you, then this app is for you:

> “When I try to improve my life (exercise more, learn a new language, read more books), I feel sooo unhappy and disconnected from my progress — sometimes even from my life.”

Let’s be honest — if we only look forward to the *victory* and not the *journey*, lifelong improvement can start to feel like a chore.  
Plant A Seed helps you fall back in love with your own growth 🌱

## 🌼 What Does This App Do?

- **Track your progress** toward any goal (but in a way that feels *fun* and *low-pressure*!)
- For every goal, you **plant a seed** in your personal garden — you can customize its name, plant type, and growth duration.
- Every day (or whenever you like), you **water your seed** by logging real-world progress.  
  While watering, the app gently checks in on your **mood** and encourages you to celebrate your small wins.
- You can also **write a petal letter** to your future self — a kind message that arrives back in your garden later, reminding you of how far you’ve come.

Try it out and see how fun the journey of self-improvement can be — one seed, one step, one smile at a time. 🌸
