# 🌱 User Journey — *Plant A Seed*

> A gentle journey that turns goal tracking into self-kindness and fun.

---

**Plant A Seed** is built around the idea that growth should *feel good*.  

The app encourages users to track progress on their goals through a nurturing, garden-themed interface.  
Each interaction reinforces the message: *You’re growing, and that’s something to celebrate.*

## 🧭 User Persona
**Name:** Alexi  
**Age:** 20–35  
**Mood:** Motivated but often self-critical, tends to self-doubt, and burnt out from “grind culture.”  
**Goal:** To improve in areas like fitness, learning, or career — but to *enjoy the process* instead of resenting it.  
**Need:** A tool that makes progress tracking gentle, rewarding, and emotionally meaningful.

## 🌿 User Journey (Version 0.1 MVP)

### 1. Entering the Garden
- When the user opens the app, they arrive at their **Garden View**.  
- If they’re new, the garden is an empty plot of soil — peaceful and inviting.  
- A short line greets them, e.g.,  
  > “Welcome, gardener. Every big dream starts with a single seed.”

**Emotional goal:** Calm curiosity and excitement.

---

### 2. Planting a Seed (Creating a Goal)
- The user clicks an empty patch and the prompt for **“Plant a Seed”**.  
- A **Plant Seed Pop-Up** appears with fields:
  - Seed name (goal name)
  - Plant type (visual identifier)
  - Bloom duration (estimated time to achieve goal)
  - Watering frequency (how often they plan to log progress)
  - Short goal description (why this goal matters)

- Once confirmed, the seed is planted in the garden with a small sprout animation and name tag.

**Emotional goal:** Hopefulness, anticipation, ownership.

---

### 3. Watering the Seed (Logging Progress + Mood)
- On the Garden View, the user sees a **watering can** icon.  
- They select a plant, click the watering can, and a small animation plays:  
  > Water pours over the plant → a small growth change appears (new leaves, taller stem, etc.)
- A **Watering Prompt** opens asking the required questions:
  - “What progress did you make today?”
  - “How did that make you feel?” (emoji or slider)
- The response is saved in their log and the plant subtly grows.

**Emotional goal:** Satisfaction, gentle self-awareness.

---

### 4. Writing a Petal Letter (Self-Reflection)
- A **message jar** icon is visible on the garden screen.  
- Clicking it opens a **Petal Letters Pop-Up**, offering two options:
  - “Write a note for your current self” (instant message)
  - “Send a note to your future self” (arrives after X hours/days)
- Notes appear as floating petals or leaves, which the user can revisit later.

**Emotional goal:** Self-compassion, encouragement, continuity, accountability.

---

### 5. Viewing Growth Over Time
- A small **Timeline View** button shows a fast-motion replay of the user’s garden evolving (GIF or simple animation).  
- This view can include time stamps and milestone markers (e.g., “Day 10 — first bloom!”).

**Emotional goal:** Pride, gratitude, perspective.

## ✨ Key Takeaways
- **Every action should feel rewarding**, not obligatory.  
- **The garden is a metaphor for self-trust**: even slow growth matters.  
- **Mood tracking + reflection** are baked into the flow, not added on top.  
- **Visual feedback = emotional feedback.** Growth should *feel* like growth.

*Next Step:* Define wireframes for Garden View and Plant Seed pop-up.  
(*Optional:* Add emotional quotes or micro-interactions to reinforce positive psychology.)
