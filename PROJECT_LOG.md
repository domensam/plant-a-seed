## 🧭 Log Entries

### 🗓️ 2025-10-26 — Starting the Garden
**Focus:** Project setup and idea refinement  
**Progress:**  
- Created repo `plant-a-seed`  
- Wrote initial `README.md`  
- Defined user pain points and emotional goals  
- Chose 3 core mechanics: Visual Growth, Mood Reflection, Self-Message Jar  
- Wrote `user-journey.md` to describe emotional + interaction flow  

**Challenges:**  
- Hard to balance between “fun” and “too simple”  
- Felt overwhelmed deciding where to start and which to focus on  

**Lessons:**  
- Planning first helps calm the chaos, each file adds clarity.  
- Focusing on the emotional experience first (not the tech stack) makes the idea feel real to me.

**Next Action:**  
- Start sketching or outlining **Garden View** and **Plant Seed Pop-Up** (Option A MVP).  
- Create basic wireframes or component outline for these two screens.

## 📝 Reflections (Running Notes)
- This app is a reminder that improvement can be gentle, even in code.
- Each entry feels like planting a seed; one that’ll grow into a garden of small wins that I can share with others hopefully :D
